<p>The World Wide Web is made of a collection of <b>HTML</b> documents. <b>HTML</b>
stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>.
   The links between these documents are called Hyperlinks.
</p>
<p>The major pieces are (1) you (2) your computer (browser) (3) the Internet and
  (4) servers. Your browser uses a protocol called HTTP to communicate on the
    Internet with the servers.
  </p>
<p>HTML is made up of <em>tags</em> which look like this:<br>
<br><b>&ltname> Contents &lt/name></b> where:<br><br>
<b>&ltname></b> is the opening tag and <b>&lt/name></b> is the closing tag.</p>
<p>The whole structure with opening and closing tags is called an <b>element</b>.</p>
<p>Some example tags are:<br>
&ltb> - make text <b>bold</b><br>
&ltem> - make text <em>italic</em><br></p>

<b>HTML Attributes:</b><br>
<p>HTML attributes provide additional information to the tag and look like this:</p>
<p>&ltTAG ATTR="value"> contents &lt/TAG>. HTML tags may use multiple
  attributes.
</p>
<p>A very common HTML tag that uses an attribute is the <b>&lta></b> anchor tag which
  is used for embedding hypertext links in a web page:</p>
<p>Example:<br><b>&lta href="www.reddit.com"> derp &lt/a></b> creates a link to
  <a href="www.reddit.com">Reddit.com</a>. In this example, <em><b>href</b></em>
  is the attribute name.
</p>
<p>Another common HTML tag with attributes is the <b>&ltimg></b> tag which is used
  for embedding images into a webpage, like this:
  <img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png">
</p>
<p>Example:<br>
  <b>&ltimg src="url" alt="text"></b> displays the image linked to by the URL. "src" is the
  attribute that points to the image. "alt" is the text that will be displayed in
  the case of a broken link and is also useful for accessibility options such as
  browsers for the blind.
</p>
<p>An &ltimg> tag is a type of <b>void</b> tag. A void tag is one with no content. Since it
  is a void tag, no closing tag is needed.
</p>
<p>HTML handles whilespace (such as newlines, tabs and spaces) as a single space.</p>
<p>The <b>&ltbr></b> tag is a void tag which inserts a new line. Multiple &ltbr> tags
  may be used.
</p>
<p>The <b>&ltp></b> (paragraph) tag is similar to the &ltbr> tag but it is not a void tag
  and it has content and requires a closing tag.
</p>
<p>
The &ltbr> tag is an <b>Inline</b> type of tag and the &ltp> tag is a type of <b>Block</b>
tag. The &ltbr> tag simply inserts a newline into the text. The &ltp> tag creates an
"invisible box" which can have height and width. Of the elements covered so far, the &ltp>
element is the only one that is a block element.
</p>
<p>Two other important elements are <b>&ltspan></b> and <b>&ltdiv></b>. &ltspan>
  is an inline type of element and &lt/div> is a block type. Both of these elements are
  used to contain their context. Later these will be used for applying styles along with
  CSS.
</p>
<p><b>HTML Document Structure</b></p>
<p>A complete HTML document consists of several sections, they are:<br><br>
  1. The Doctype (will be covered more later)<br><br>
  2. The opening HTML tag: <b>&ltHTML></b> which, along with <b>&lt/HTML></b> just surround
  the entire document.<br><br>
  3. The Head, which is contained within &lthead> and &lt/head>. The head contains metadata
  used by things like Javascript and CSS. It also contains the Title of the webpage, inside
  the <b>&lttitle></b> element. The title is what appears in the top of the browser window
  or tab.<br><br>
  4. The Body, which contains the contents of the document within the &ltbody> tag.
